accidents.db
```

Main table:

```
accidents
```

Important columns:

- location
- road_cases
- road_injured
- road_died
- railway_cases

## 🚦 Risk Classification

| Road Accident Cases | Risk Level |
|--------------------|------------|
| ≥ 20,000 | 🔴 High Risk |
| 10,000 – 19,999 | 🟠 Medium Risk |
| < 10,000 | 🟢 Low Risk |
